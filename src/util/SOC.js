This is because higher level languages are designed to be closer and friendlier to the programmer, thereby creating distance with the machine. This distance is covered by translators called compilers and interpreters. The aim of programming in assembly language is to bypass these intermediates and talk directly with the computer. An assembly language and its more primitive variant, machine language, has a structure that reflects the hardware architecture of a specific computer. While an assembly language might have constructs that facilitate solution of a specific class of problems, this reflects only the fact that the underlying hardware architecture has been designed with that goal in mind.",
