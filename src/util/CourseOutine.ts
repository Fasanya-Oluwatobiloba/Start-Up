					"Assembly language programming develops a very basic and low level understanding of the computer. In higher level languages there is a distance between the computer and the programmer. This is because higher level languages are designed to be closer and friendlier to the programmer, thereby creating distance with the machine. This distance is covered by translators called compilers and interpreters. The aim of programming in assembly language is to bypass these intermediates and talk directly with the computer. An assembly language and its more primitive variant, machine language, has a structure that reflects the hardware architecture of a specific computer. While an assembly language might have constructs that facilitate solution of a specific class of problems, this reflects only the fact that the underlying hardware architecture has been designed with that goal in mind.",

It covers topics in radiation sources â€“ natural and artificial sources. Charged and uncharged particles and their nature, properties and mechanisms of interaction with matter and dealt with. Nuclear instrumentation and radiation detection techniques are described. Closely following these are the descriptions of different types of nuclear radiation detectors and their applications. Nuclear spectroscopy such as gamma and alpha particle spectroscopy and their application in the analysis of mixed radiation sources are also taken care of in the course. The course also has a section on neutron physics â€“ production, detection, uses, properties and interaction with matter. Nuclear reactor physics and application is a part of the course. Students taking the course will be trained in the production of nuclear energy through fission and fusion. The last part of the course is devoted to elementary particles â€“ conservation laws, partial classification, strong electromagnetic and weak interactions.",
